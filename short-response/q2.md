# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer

SPAs are easy to scale since you can use things like dynamic pathways. They can also allow for a smoother user experience since only one page is being used. SPAs render the relevant components at the right time giving the illusion of visiting a new page.

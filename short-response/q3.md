# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer

It is appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a fallback component. This will work because more specific paths will be recognized over `"*"`. However, if no other path is recognized, the `"*"` path will be rendered.

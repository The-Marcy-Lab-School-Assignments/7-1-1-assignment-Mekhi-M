# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

`2` and `3`.

`1` will not match because it does not have the dynamic segment.
`4` will not match because it has a segment after the dynamic segment.

`2` and `3` will match because they start with `/products` and have a dynamic segment to end the path.
